Areas of Aritificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computational Sciences currently being explored heavily:

Medical Imaging /GPU Acceleration Medical Image Segmentation using Deep Learning (Generative Adversarial Networks) : eg: IODeep + MedPipe3D.jl + MedResearch (papers from : ArXiv/ Scientific Direct/ Nature Journal)
Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, Evaluation of LLMS, Hallucinations in LLMS,  (ScaleAI research topics, NolanoAI focus areas, Robust Reading Competition) : eg DOCVQA, MEDVQA,Hierarchical multimodal Transformers, on-prem foundational models.
Vector Search Datasets and Databases eg: ChromaDB,Pinecone, Elasticsearch
Understanding and Implementing Graph Convolutional Neural Networks, and graph databases (GRAPHQL, GraphCNN in julia, SciML)
Federated Machine Learning eg: Pysyft 
GPU Programming / GPU Acceleration Using CUDA
