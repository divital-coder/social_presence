Working with virtual environments within arch linux:

--Anaconda installation doesn't seem logical since its pain staking slow to install packages using conda.
--An alternative discovered when dealing with tensorflow installation on anaconda on windows, is miniforge.
--By defauly virtual environments on arch doesn't make sense, because all of the pytohn pacakges get installed system-wide from the AUR. 
--There is no pip installation of python on arch. (for me atleast)

--Referring to the following miniforge github repository, for arch linux installation which comes base installed with a base environment (current system-wide system), "mamba" and "conda" preinstalled. 
https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/#download

--installation of packages via the conda-forge channel.
--Activate the <environment_name> by "mamba activate <environment_name>"
--start installation pacakges either by mamba or by pip from a requirements file.
"mamba install <package_name>"
or 
"pip install -r requirements.txt"
